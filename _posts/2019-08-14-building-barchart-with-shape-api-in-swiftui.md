This week I want to show you how to use *Shape* API in SwiftUI. We will take a look at ready to use shapes like *Circle, Capsule, Rectangle*, etc. We will learn how to draw super custom shapes by using *Path* and *GeometryReader*. In the end, we will build *BarChart* implementation ultimately in SwiftUI.

#### Shape protocol
SwiftUI provides *Shape* protocol which has a single requirement *path* function. We use *path* function to describe our shape inside a provided rectangle. Let's try to use it to draw a progress ring.

```swift
struct ProgressShape: Shape {
    let progress: Double

    func path(in rect: CGRect) -> Path {
        var path = Path()
        path.addArc(
            center: CGPoint(x: rect.midX, y: rect.midY),
            radius: rect.width / 2,
            startAngle: .radians(1.5 * .pi),
            endAngle: .init(radians: 2 * Double.pi * progress + 1.5 * Double.pi),
            clockwise: false
        )
        return path
    }
}
```

Here we use a little math to calculate *arc* which describes our progress. *Shape* protocol conforms to *View* protocol that's why we can easily use it inside *Stack* or *Group*. We can also customize default drawing by setting custom *StrokeStyle*.

```swift
struct ProgressView: View {
    let progress: Double

    var body: some View {
        ProgressShape(progress: progress)
            .stroke(Color.blue,
                    style: StrokeStyle(
                        lineWidth: 4,
                        lineCap: .round,
                        lineJoin: .round,
                        miterLimit: 0,
                        dash: [],
                        dashPhase: 0
                    )
        )
    }
}
```

#### Ready to use shapes
We discussed how to draw custom shapes, but most of the time, it is enough to apply ready to use shapes provided by SwiftUI. SwiftUI offers shapes like *Circle, Capsule, Rectangle*, etc. We can easily use them to build *BarChart* in SwiftUI. Let's start by describing the Bar data model.

```swift
struct Legend: Hashable {
    let color: Color
    let label: String
}

struct Bar: Identifiable {
    let id: UUID
    let value: Double
    let label: String
    let legend: Legend
}
```

As you can see, our *Bar* struct conforms to *Identifiable* protocol. We need *Identifiable* conformance to use *Bar* struct inside *ForEach*. *ForEach* uses *Identifiable* to understand data changes during the rendering process. Now we can draw our bars by using shape *Capsule*.

```swift
struct BarsView: View {
    let bars: [Bar]
    let max: Double

    init(bars: [Bar]) {
        self.bars = bars
        self.max = bars.map { $0.value }.max() ?? 0
    }

    var body: some View {
        GeometryReader { geometry in
            HStack(alignment: .bottom, spacing: 0) {
                ForEach(self.bars) { bar in
                    Capsule()
                        .fill(bar.legend.color)
                        .frame(height: CGFloat(bar.value) / CGFloat(self.max) * geometry.size.height)
                        .overlay(Rectangle().stroke(Color.white))
                        .accessibility(label: Text(bar.label))
                        .accessibility(value: Text(bar.legend.label))
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Here we implement *BarsView* which uses *HStack* to display capsules in the horizontal layout. Another interesting fact here is *GeometryReader*. By wrapping any view inside the *GeometryReader*, we can access the geometry data like parent size and safe area insets provided by its container. We use container size to calculate the height of bars and draw them properly. We also use accessibility modifier here to make our bars more accessible and navigable.

Every chart should have a legend view. Let's implement it by using another regular shape provided by SwiftUI. I want to display legends as a view which contains a small colored circle on the left and title on the right.

```swift
struct LegendView: View {
    private let legends: [Legend]

    init(bars: [Bar]) {
        legends = Array(Set(bars.map { $0.legend }))
    }

    var body: some View {
        HStack(alignment: .center) {
            ForEach(legends, id: \.self) { legend in
                VStack(alignment: .center) {
                    Circle()
                        .fill(legend.color)
                        .frame(width: 16, height: 16)

                    Text(legend.label)
                        .font(.subheadline)
                        .lineLimit(nil)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the example above, we use *Ð¡ircle* shape to draw color indicators of every *Legend*. Now we can compose our *BarsView* and *LegendsView* to provide *BarChart* experience.

```swift
struct BarChartView: View {
    let bars: [Bar]

    var body: some View {
        Group {
            if bars.isEmpty {
                Text("There is no data to display chart...")
            } else {
                VStack {
                    BarsView(bars: bars)
                    LegendView(bars: bars)
                        .padding()
                        .accessibility(hidden: true)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Here we have *BarChartView* which puts *BarsView and LegendsView* inside the *VStack*. We also use accessibility modifier to hide *LegendsView* in the *Accessibility tree*.

#### Real-life example
I use the source code from this post to implement *BarChart* in my *SleepBot* app. Besides the implementation which we have in the current post, I've added *LabelsView*. *LabelsView* presents the *BarChart* labels below the chart itself. Here is the implementation of that view.

```swift
struct LabelsView: View {
    let bars: [Bar]
    let labelsCount: Int

    private var threshold: Int {
        let threshold = bars.count / labelsCount
        return threshold == 0 ? 1 : threshold
    }

    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            ForEach(0..<bars.count, id: \.self) { index in
                Group {
                    if index % self.threshold == 0 {
                        Spacer()
                        Text(self.bars[index].label)
                            .font(.caption)
                        Spacer()
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Take a look at the final version of *BarChartView* in *SleepBot* app.

#### Conclusion
Today we talked about *Shape* API which we have in SwiftUI. We also build *BarChart* experience by using ready to use *Capsule* and *Circle* shapes. We made our chart accessible by providing labels and values for our bars. Feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mecid) and ask your questions related to this post.
