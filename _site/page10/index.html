    <p>SwiftUI is a declarative framework for building User Interfaces on Apple platforms. The keyword here is <strong>declarative</strong>.  Declarative means that you need to declare what you want to achieve, and the framework takes care of it. Framework knows the best way to render the User Interface, which you declare.</p>

    <p>This week we will talk about reusing SwiftUI views between Apple platforms. We will learn how to run the same views both on iOS, watchOS and macOS without any changes. To make it possible, all we need is an understanding of the view decomposition principle.</p>

    <p>This week I want to talk about another crucial feature of any app, which is <em>Localization</em>. Every user expects that your app correctly uses environment features like the right-to-left layout or uses system locale to format dates or currencies. Another vital thing here is translations, and this week, we will learn which tools SwiftUI provides to add in our apps as many languages as we can.</p>

    <p>This week I want to talk to you about Dynamic Type support in SwiftUI. I think there is no way to create an excellent user experience without Dynamic Type support in your apps. SwiftUI provides Dynamic Type out of the box for any text representation and simplifies our job. But we still need to do some work, so let’s talk about it.</p>

    <p>This week I want to continue the topic of using a <em>Redux-like state container in SwiftUI</em>. I’m delighted with the new approach and already finished the refactoring of the <a href="https://napbot.swiftwithmajid.com">NapBot app</a> in this way. That’s why today I want to share with you how I use <em>Container Views</em> with a state container similar to <em>Redux</em>.</p>

    <p>Last week we talked about <a href="/2019/09/18/redux-like-state-container-in-swiftui/">building a state container similar to Redux in SwiftUI</a>. <em>Redux</em> provides a single source of truth, which eliminates tons of bugs produced by multiple states across the app. This week we will talk about best practices in building <em>Redux-based</em> apps which allows us to keep our codebase simple and clean.</p>

    <p>This week we will talk about building a state container similar to <em>Redux</em> and <em>The Elm Architecture</em> that provides a single source of truth for your app. A single state for the whole app makes it easier to debug and inspect. Single source of truth eliminates tons of bugs produced by creating multiple states across the app.</p>

    <p>This week I want to talk to you about <em>Accessibility in SwiftUI</em>. SwiftUI provides a ready to use accessibility implementation for standard User Interface elements like <em>Text, Button, Toggle, etc</em>. In most of the cases, you don’t need to do something additional to make it work. But I will show how you can modify the accessibility tree by using accessibility modifiers to improve your User Experience.</p>

    <p>This week I want to talk about the styling of views in SwiftUI. SwiftUI provides a pretty composable architecture for building your apps. Every screen in terms of SwiftUI is a function on some data which returns a view. So let’s talk today about composable and highly reusable styling options which we have in SwiftUI.</p>
