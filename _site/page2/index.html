    <p>During our careers, we primarily build apps that work with web services to retrieve and upload data. Remote image is one type of that data that we need to download and display. SwiftUI provides us the <em>AsyncImage</em> type, which is a view that downloads and shows an image via URL. This week we learn how to use and customize <em>AsyncImage</em> in SwiftUI.</p>

    <p>Button is one of the crucial components of any app. We use buttons to provide actions in the user interface of the app. SwiftUI 3 released a bunch of new view modifiers that allow us to style buttons in different ways. New <em>bordered</em> and <em>borderedProminent</em> button styles in conjunction with <em>controlSize</em> and <em>buttonBorderShape</em> view modifiers can change button presentation drastically.</p>

    <p>SwiftUI Release 3.0 brought tons of expected features that we missed in previous iterations. One of them is the ability to provide the search feature in our apps. Fortunately, we have a new <em>searchable</em> view modifier. This week, we will learn about the new <em>searchable</em> modifier and how to build a great search experience using it.</p>

    <p>List is the crucial view for many apps. I can’t imagine an app that doesn’t use a list view anywhere in the view hierarchy. During WWDC21, list view became even more powerful and brought us all the needed features of <em>UITableView</em>. This week, we will learn how to use the list view in SwiftUI and master its features.</p>

    <p>WWDC21 is finally here, and there are many new things in the updated version of SwiftUI. I’m happy to share with you that many items on my wishlist have finally arrived. In this post, I will try to give you a summary of the significant SwiftUI additions of this year.</p>

    <p>SwiftUI provides us a magical frame modifier that you might think is very simple and straightforward to use. But there is a lot of complicated logic under the hood. This week we will talk about fixed and flexible frames and the frame modifier to control them.</p>

    <p>WWDC21 is coming pretty soon, and it is a great chance to think about the new features that I want to see in SwiftUI. This wishlist contains not only the list of the features I want to use but also possible APIs. Remember that this post is the result of my imagination, and most of the code examples don’t exist at the moment.</p>

    <p>I’ve already covered a few essential topics from the Combine framework story. We talked about handling errors and chaining operations, but today I want to talk about running multiple operations in parallel and handing results in a single place. This week we will learn how to use zip, merge and combine operators.</p>

    <p>The Combine framework provides you a bunch of operators to map, filter, and chain asynchronous operations. This week I want to focus on the chaining asynchronous jobs using two main operators that the Combine framework provides us. We will learn how to use <em>flatMap</em> and <em>switchToLatest</em> operators to chain asynchronous tasks in a declarative way.</p>

    <p>Combine looks like a very sophisticated framework and provides you all the needed things you might need to process your data. It comes with many valuable operators like map, filter, and reduce. This week we will learn how to build new operators that we might miss from the default package.</p>
