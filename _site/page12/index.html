    <p>Last week we started a new series of <a href="/2019/06/05/swiftui-making-real-world-app">posts</a> about SwiftUI framework. Today I want to continue this topic by covering <em>Property Wrappers</em> provided by SwiftUI. SwiftUI gives us <em>@State</em>, <em>@Binding</em>, <em>@ObservedObject</em>, <em>@EnvironmentObject</em>, and <em>@Environment</em> <em>Property Wrappers</em>. So let’s try to understand the differences between them and when and why which one we have to use.</p>

    <p>That is WWDC week: everybody is so excited about so many new things like SwiftUI, Dark Mode, updateable Core ML models, etc. I will try to cover all the new stuff during the upcoming weeks. Let’s start with SwiftUI. SwiftUI is an entirely new approach to building apps for the Apple ecosystem.</p>

    <p>Last week before WWDC and everybody so excited about new features which we will have just in a few days. However, let’s keep posts related to WWDC for next week. This week we are going to talk about my favorite design pattern <em>Delegate</em>. <em>Delegate</em> is the most straightforward and powerful pattern.</p>

    <p>Most of our apps are REST clients for some backends. During the development of this kind of apps, we want to keep it working offline. In this case, we have to cache data somewhere locally on the device to make it readable without an internet connection.</p>

    <p>Last week we touched the entirely new topic on my blog. This week we will continue the Unit Testing subject. One of the smells of a good architecture is the ability to cover it with Unit Tests. Today we will talk about extracting Presentation logic into testable and straightforward pieces of code.</p>

    <p>Today we are going to touch the completely new topic on my blog, and it is Unit Testing. Most of us heard about the pros of Unit Testing. I want to show how easily you can start with Unit Testing by covering your model layer. So let’s start with the definition.</p>

    <p><a href="/2019/01/23/maintaining-state-in-view-controllers/">Enums are one of my favorite features in Swift language.</a> This week we will talk about Result enum, which had been a part of the standard library since Swift 5. With Result enum, we can easily describe the resulting state of an asynchronous operation. It can be success or failure at one time not both of them. Let’s take a look at Result enum definition in the Swift standard library.</p>

    <p>Enums are one of the most powerful features of Swift language. It forms Value-Oriented Programming in conjunction with Structs. Enum is the best way to describe the exclusive state in Swift, but what about the case when you need an inclusive state. Today we will talk about OptionSet protocol and how we can achieve inclusive states with it.</p>

I think it is essential to support iPad screens and efficiently use that space. This week we will talk about adapting apps for iPad with the help of UISplitViewController.</p>
