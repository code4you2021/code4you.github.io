    <p>This week I want to talk about building a networking layer in Swift using <em>Functional programming</em>. <em>Functional programming</em> is a way of making programs using <em>pure functions and function composition</em>. Let’s see how we can use it to build a flexible and composable network layer.</p>

    <p>This week I want to continue the series of posts about building custom interactive views in SwiftUI. Today we will create a pager view. <em>ScrollView</em> in SwiftUI support only scrolling content and doesn’t have paging behavior. That’s why we will build a pager view that supports paging mode.</p>

    <p>Last week we started a series of posts about developing interactive components using SwiftUI, where we talked about building the bottom sheet. We need to understand the power of <em>@ViewBuilder</em> before moving to the next post about building another interactive view. That’s why this week, we will talk about <em>@ViewBuilder</em> and its benefits while developing custom views.</p>

    <p>This week I want to start a series of posts about building interactive view components that Apple heavily uses in its apps but doesn’t include them into the SDK. Let’s begin with the bottom sheet. I think everybody used Apple Maps, Shortcut or Apple Music apps. There is a draggable sheet at the bottom of the screen. It looks like bottom sheet is going to be a must-use component, so let’s try to implement it in SwiftUI.</p>

    <p>Currently, I have three ongoing SwiftUI projects. During my work on these projects, I find myself in copying some extension files, which are very helpful in any SwiftUI based project.  That’s why I decide to share with you that small foundation of useful extensions.</p>

    <p><em>Combine</em> is one of the new frameworks released during WWDC 2019. It provides a declarative <em>Swift API</em> for processing values over time. Today we will talk about one of the hidden features of SwiftUI views, which is <em>onReceive</em> modifier. It allows views to subscribe and react as soon as the publisher emits the value.</p>

    <p>Last week I saw that the community tries to move <em>UIKit</em> development patterns to SwiftUI. But I’m sure that the best way to write efficient SwiftUI is to forget everything about <em>UIKit</em> and entirely change your mindset in terms of User Interface development. This week we will learn the main differences between <em>UIKit</em> and SwiftUI development.</p>

    <p>One thing which I really enjoy about SwiftUI is the fact that SwiftUI has a lot of stuff ready to use out of the box. In order to build your app, all you need to do is composing the building blocks provided by SwiftUI into a fully functional application. This week we will talk about <em>Gradient</em>, which is just another type of <em>View</em> in SwiftUI.</p>

In the <em>Functional Programming</em> world, we usually replace delegates with closures. This week we will learn how to use closures to make SwiftUI views composable and decoupled.</p>
