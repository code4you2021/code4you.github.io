    <p>Usually, I try to avoid <em>GeometryReader</em> as much as I can. But sometimes, we need it to build our custom view. This week we will talk about <em>GeometryReader</em>. The view that allows us to read its geometry and layout child views manually.</p>

    <p>Redacted modifier is the thing that will have a great impact on how iOS apps handle loading states. During WWDC20, Apple showed us the easy way of hiding the data from home-screen widgets using the redacted modifier. Today we will talk about using the redacted modifier to hide sensitive data and handle loading states.</p>

    <p>Styleable views is the thing I love in SwiftUI. You can separate your view logic and its style. You can easily apply different styles in different conditions whenever you need to change appearance depending on the platform or other environmental requirements. This week we will talk about <em>GroupBox</em>, another view container that SwiftUI provides, and allows us easily change its look and feel using a style protocol.</p>

    <p>Animations play a vital role in SwiftUI. We saw a lot of examples of complex animations that we can easily implement in SwiftUI. The guidance for building fluid animations in SwiftUI has the only one step: mutate your state, and SwiftUI will automatically animate changes in your views. Today we will talk about transactions, which is a hidden gem of SwiftUI.</p>

    <p>We had the scroll view from the very first version of SwiftUI. It was quite limited. But this year changed everything when Apple released <em>ScrollViewReader</em> during WWDC 20. This week we will learn all about scroll views in SwiftUI. We will learn how to scroll to the particular position and read the current offset of scroll view content.</p>

    <p>This week we will talk about another excellent UI component called <em>OutlineGroup</em>. Apple released <em>OutlineGroup</em> during the WWDC20 side-by-side with other great things, including grids, menus, and toolbars. I already covered them in my previous posts. And finally, today is time to talk about <em>OutlineGroup</em> and <em>DisclosureGroup</em> that handles the expanding behavior.</p>

This week we will understand how to manage our apps using <em>App</em> protocol without old <em>AppDelegate</em>. We will learn how to achieve the same set of features with <em>App</em> protocol.</p>
